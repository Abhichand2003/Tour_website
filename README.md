# Tour_website
The tourism industry faces a great challenge in the age of information technology development. The traditional tourism distribution channel faces a threat from the emerging IT environment. 
Throughout the years the tourism industry was dependent on intermediaries, who enabled the interaction between the suppliers and the customers.
